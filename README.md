- This project contains html, css , and javascript. It was a challenge that personally helped me wrap my head around local storage properties and the options that I have to work with when it comes to dynamically changing elements on a webpage while working with javascript. It also helped me to clear up some blockers I was dealing with understanding boths functions and scope.
